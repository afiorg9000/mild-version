Being in the Bay has dramatically changed my life and twice when I was seriously considering moving back you kept me around. It's inspiring to see your zany side while also upholding a strong professional career while also doing good; you take having fun seriously and are serious about making the world better, and that's really inspiring.\n\nI really appreciate you Ryan, you've consistently been a stellar person to know and and am so grateful we're friends.",

    growthArea: "I think you have strong opinions and I wonder if it'd be helpful to hear people's thoughts more before adding your own. There can be an inherent bias to trust people that speak with authority and that can dissuade people from sharing their own, or trusting it (I might be biased in the opposite direction though)",
    yearVision: "I have no doubt he'll continue on the smashing success he's already been doing, and on the path towards. I expect that he'll face setbacks but nothing that will be too much.\n\nI hope you both are able to get your house set up and form a good group of people to be around. I'm very excited about this, and for what the rest of the year has in store for you :)",

    impact: "A wonderful conversationalist, a technological optimist and loving best friend to one of the best persons I know.",
    unforgettableMemory: "We were in the car, which is basically the modern confessional booth‚Äîexcept instead of revealing sins, we play each other's obscure Spotify finds and pretend the GPS voice isn't secretly judging our turns. Josh‚Äî an old friend turned \"we are still working it out\" denial stage ‚Äîwas driving, and for once, he wasn't being casually possessive about controlling the AUX. Growth.\n\nPhone rings. He answers. On speakerphone. Not \"let's both hear this comfortably\" speakerphone. I mean the \"welcome to a TED Talk, here's the mic in your molars\" kind of loud.\n\nIt's his best friend, Ryan. Now, Ryan is the kind of guy who asks the emotionally loaded questions you'd normally leave to a therapist‚Äîor at least, a text message. He has all the tact of a toddler holding a live squirrel. Which is a trait, I believe, to be genuinely lovable and compelling. (I have the capacity to be quite similar).\n\nAs I set the scene, Josh is parking the car in a Coles car park. So, we're just vibing, and Ryan comes in hot with:\n\n\"Sooo... is she your actual girlfriend now, or‚Ä¶\"\n\nOh Ryan, you have the subtlety of a marching band and the filter of Facebook in 2009.\n\nMeanwhile, I swear I could hear Josh's brain buffering. He looked at the phone like it had just asked him if he believed in moral relativism. I turned slowly, like the girl in a horror movie with a smirk that couldn't help him.\n\nThere were options here. Infinite ways to handle this.\n\n\"‚Ä¶Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh.\"\n\nIt wasn't even a normal \"uhh.\" It was long. Like he thought if he stretched it out enough, maybe the question would vanish into the ether. Spoiler: it didn't.\n\nI smirked. Just turned to watch him squirm, utterly content. I could've helped him. Could've jumped in. But why interrupt greatness?\n\nRyan was loving it too.\n\nI leaned a little toward the phone and said, coolly:\n\n\"Thank you, Ryan. Thank you so much for asking this. That was beautiful.\"\n\nJosh groaned with a grin. I smiled like a cat in the sun.\n\nBecause sometimes love is soft and poetic.\n\nAnd sometimes it's a public identity crisis in a getz with two people smirking at your expense.",

I have enjoyed and have been proud, as a father, of Ryan's many achievements in all areas of his life. Excelling in all the years of his education, constantly winning awards and finally securing the job he worked so hard for. Ryan's All Saints yearbook read 'The person most likely to change the world'. Which he is doing now, well done, son.",
    unforgettableMemory: "Regina and I wanted Ryan to be accepted by All Saints Anglican School, but were informed that it was not possible. Ryan sat for the scholarship exam, excelling in English but did not make the grade in maths due to his previous schooling. So, he missed out. We asked for a meeting with the Headmaster Patrick Wallas, and it was granted. During that meeting, Ryan showed Patrick the book he was writing and they found they had a kinship in the literary interests. At that point, Ryan had talked his way into the school. The Headmaster's class was English for only the best students and Ryan was included. An annual literary contest called the Pegasus award was awarded annually by Patrick. Ryan got the bronze the first year, silver the second, and gold the third year with his short story. His story went on to win an award with James Cook University with a cash prize and future publishing rights.",
    whatToHear: "Ryan, you have been a wonderful part of our family, doing everything that you set out to do in your life. I have enjoyed being there for your life experiences. You have made it, son, to be all you can be and there is more to come. Ryan, whatever you took on in life, being all the years of your education, becoming a Queen's Scout, constantly winning debating competitions, the gold Pegasus award and finally the Doctor of Philosophy degree in quantum physics. You did whatever was necessary and I am very proud of it all, thanks.",

    name: "Mum",
    impact: "Becoming Ryan's mother was transformative, expanding my internal and external experiences and my capacity for loving, nurturing, and learning. Getting to know Ryan and how best to support him in all his life stages -- from an infant to adult -- became the most important mission in my life. With Ryan, I have explored, experienced and learned about so many subjects and places that I never would have otherwise. Ryan has enriched my life beyond measure and continues to reward me with opportunities to learn and grow.",
    unforgettableMemory: "Not long after Ryan turned 2, we went to the annual Takoma Park Folk Festival where we heard the artist Sue Ribaudo sing songs about the earth and the animals that live there. I bought the cassette tape of her album Earth Celebration and played it frequently in the car, with Ryan and I singing along. I remember (and recorded in my diary on Dec 10, 1997), 'Ryan asked to hear the song about the owls and the rainforest. The song is about various animals losing their habitat. [The title of the track is Where did the owl go?] Ryan said again, as he did a couple of weeks ago, \"We must go to the forest and save the animals.\"' From a very early age, Ryan had a desire to make a positive difference, to make the world a better place.\n\nMy memories of Ryan's childhood in the US are a collage of our visits to countless museums, art galleries, science centres, massive indoor play areas, concerts and festivals, puppet shows, gardens, nature and wildlife centres, parks and playgrounds, libraries, zoos, aquariums, even a water treatment plant because Ryan wanted to learn about water purification after watching The Magic School Bus At the Waterworks and reading the book. Ryan knew his way around many Smithsonian museums and had his favourite exhibits. These adventures together educated us both and enriched our relationship.\n\nRyan's hunger for books was insatiable; I read to him for hours each day, as did my mother when she visited. Ryan enjoyed repeat readings of favourite books and knew when even a small word had been skipped or added.\n\nI treasured the names and roles that Ryan assigned to me. First, I was Mommy Tiger and he was Baby Tiger, then we became bears, after that pigs, followed by pterodactyls, fruit bats, diplodocuses, kangaroos, elephants, mosasaurs, and penguins.",

    name: "Sonia",
    impact: "Your parties have been some of the best experiences of my life. Before them I merely felt grateful for the miracle of overcoming my autism enough to have friends outside my family. But your parties taught me that I could not only be not awkward all the time, but charismatic. Something about the creativity everywhere at them and the fun and your supportive presence has really made me come alive. It's been so much fun exploring this new playful side of myself. It's something I've been able to bring with me to other parts of my life, and I love it so much.",
    unforgettableMemory: "When you supported me as I was going through that terrifying experience with Thor. Low self esteem is my biggest weakness, and I was so critical of myself during it in ways I eventually overcame. It meant so much to me that someone I respect as much as you was less judgmental than I was worried about, even though Thor is a great guy when he's not triggered.",

This is evident in the way you check in when I've deleted a message, the way you care about how I'm treated as a Christian in the community, the way you were so caring towards Ella during your breakup, and the way you made me sing at your dollarvision party despite me desperately wanting to chicken out.",
    growthArea: "My weakly held view is that you could live more frugally so you could donate more to charity. It's cheaper to live a little south in Oakland and take a Lyft when it's dark than to pay so much for central Berkeley housing.",

Aside from doing an excellent job running (probably) one of the most important/impactful organizations to exist in our lifetimes, which in itself is massively inspirational, he is a really great human being. He is incredibly tenacious, principled, intelligent, funny, and kind. Ryan has been an exceptional friend to me and to all of the people around him, he seems to deeply care about his community to a degree that is incredibly rare.",

However, I really liked him and had a feeling that our paths would cross again.",

When I drop into just how precarious this world is, how close we stand to the edge of everything we know, how the future hangs by threads too fine for most to see, my chest gets overwhelmingly heavy, it takes my tears and my breath away, being with the vastness of possibility stretching before us, how the future projects to unfold in countless branching paths, some bright, some dark. I don't know what comes next. And yet‚Ä¶ here I am, here we are, alive in this moment, moving through it together. Whatever the future holds, whether it's decades of gradual progress or humanity has only a few chapters left to write, I'm grateful we get to experience history together in this chapter of our lives. Being a home for each other through all the tension and stress, sharing tears, healing, laughter, and appreciation for it all. It just feels so right somehow.\n\nYou remind me why living matters. Why my own health, my rest, and a love like ours are worth fighting for. You meet parts of me that no one else ever has, with such real love, care, and acceptance. And even if the little light we've been working so hard to keep alive someday flickers out, I'll still be glad we were here. That we chose to keep fighting, working on ourselves, on each other, on our friends, our work, our words, loving passionately and intensely, striving to overcome our own limitations. The fact that you exist means I had never really been alone in this, I just didn't know it yet. Your empathy, your compassion, your will to power, your commitment, your strength, your drive to push through to the other side, all of these will always stand as an exemplar of the kind of human others should strive to be. Everything in me wants to keep growing, creating, and striving alongside you for a future worth creating. Whatever comes, I'm so grateful we have what we have now.\n\nüíô",
